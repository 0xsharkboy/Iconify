Iconify was mainly created to change the system icons of any aosp rom. But then I got bored of using substratum. Picking and installing overlays one by one without any previews made me frustrated. So I decided to make it easier for me by creating an application where I can one click change anything I want. This was totally for my personal use but as people showed interest, I decided to release it in public.
