<p><i>Iconify</i> is an Android application to customize your boring Android UI.</p><p><i>Iconify</i> was mainly created to change the system icons of any aosp rom. But then I got bored of using substratum. Picking and installing overlays one by one without any previews made me frustrated. So I decided to make it easier for me by creating an application where I can one click change anything I want. This was totally for my personal use but as people showed interest, I decided to release it in public.</p><p><br><b>Features:</b></p><p>What you can change using Iconify:</p><ul><li>Solid or Gradient Colors</li><li>System Icon Packs</li><li>Brightness Bar Style</li><li>QS Tile Shapes</li><li>QS Panel Row & Column</li><li>QS Panel Icon & Text Color & Size</li><li>Notification Background Style</li><li>Media Player Background Color</li><li>And many more to come...</li></ul><p><b>Requirements:</b></p><ul><li>Android 12+ AOSP Based Rom</li><li>Magisk Latest Stable Version</li><li>Decryption Supported Custom Recovery</li></ul><p><b>Instructions:</b></p><ul><li>Install and open the app</li><li>Grant root permission</li><li>Click on <code>CONTINUE</code> button</li><li>Wait for it to finish loading</li><li>Reboot the device</li><li>Now just enable whatever you want from the app</li></ul>
